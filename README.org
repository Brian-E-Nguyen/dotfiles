* Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repo! Please keep in mind that I use these configs on BSPWM ArcoLinux. You will see other window manager configs on some of the files, but those are not used yet. Also, I do apologize for some files being messy as well. Feel free to take a look around, maybe use some of my configs, and have fun with them!
